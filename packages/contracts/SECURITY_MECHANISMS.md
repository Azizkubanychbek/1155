# üõ°Ô∏è Security Mechanisms in Backpack Guilds Protocol

## Overview

The Backpack Guilds protocol now includes comprehensive security mechanisms to prevent abuse and protect users from fraudulent behavior, particularly early revokes and malicious lending practices.

## üîí Core Protection Mechanisms

### 1. Reputation System (`ReputationSystem.sol`)

**Purpose**: Track user behavior and provide trust scores to prevent bad actors from participating.

**Key Features**:
- **User Reputation Tracking**: Each user has a reputation score (0-1000)
- **Violation Reporting**: Users can report violations with reasons
- **Blacklist System**: Users with too many violations get blacklisted
- **Activity Tracking**: Monitor successful vs failed rentals

**Reputation Calculation**:
```solidity
// Base rating from success rate
uint256 successRate = (successfulRentals * 1000) / totalRentals;

// Penalties for violations
uint256 violationPenalty = violations * 100;
uint256 earlyRevokePenalty = earlyRevokes * 50;

// Final rating
uint256 rating = successRate - violationPenalty - earlyRevokePenalty;
```

**Blacklist Conditions**:
- 3+ violations ‚Üí 7-day blacklist
- Rating below 300 ‚Üí Cannot perform actions
- Early revokes tracked and penalized

### 2. Cooldown Protection (`UsageRights1155.sol`)

**Purpose**: Prevent rapid-fire revokes and abuse patterns.

**Key Features**:
- **Revoke Cooldown**: 1-hour minimum between revokes
- **Minimum Rental Duration**: 30-minute minimum rental period
- **Early Revoke Detection**: Automatic detection and reporting

**Implementation**:
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public lastRevokeTime;
uint256 public constant REVOKE_COOLDOWN = 1 hours;
uint256 public constant MIN_RENTAL_DURATION = 30 minutes;
```

### 3. Penalty System (`RentalEscrow.sol`)

**Purpose**: Economic disincentives for malicious behavior.

**Key Features**:
- **Early Revoke Penalty**: 50% of deposit goes to borrower
- **Dispute Resolution**: DAO/admin can resolve disputes
- **Automatic Penalties**: System automatically applies penalties

**Penalty Structure**:
```solidity
uint256 public constant EARLY_REVOKE_PENALTY = 50; // 50% penalty
uint256 public constant MIN_RENTAL_DURATION = 1 hours;
```

### 4. Dispute Resolution System

**Purpose**: Handle conflicts between lenders and borrowers.

**Key Features**:
- **Dispute Creation**: Either party can create a dispute
- **24-Hour Window**: Disputes must be created within 24 hours
- **DAO Resolution**: Community/admin resolves disputes
- **Automatic Penalties**: Faulty parties face reputation damage

**Dispute Process**:
1. User creates dispute with reason
2. System locks rental funds
3. DAO/admin reviews evidence
4. Resolution determines fund distribution
5. Reputation system updated

### 5. Insurance System (`RentalInsurance.sol`)

**Purpose**: Optional protection for borrowers against fraud.

**Key Features**:
- **Policy Creation**: Borrowers can buy insurance
- **Coverage Limits**: 0.01 ETH to 10 ETH coverage
- **Premium Rate**: 5% of coverage amount
- **Claim Process**: Submit claims for early revokes
- **Pool Management**: Insurance pool for payouts

**Insurance Parameters**:
```solidity
uint256 public constant PREMIUM_RATE = 5; // 5% of coverage
uint256 public constant MAX_COVERAGE = 10 ether;
uint256 public constant MIN_COVERAGE = 0.01 ether;
```

## üö® Protection Against Common Attacks

### 1. Early Revoke Attack
**Attack**: Lender grants rights, borrower pays deposit, lender immediately revokes.

**Protection**:
- ‚úÖ Cooldown period prevents rapid revokes
- ‚úÖ Early revoke detection and penalties

- ‚úÖ Reputation requirements for dispute creation

### 4. Insurance Fraud
**Attack**: Borrowers make false insurance claims.

**Protection**:
- ‚úÖ Reputation requirements for insurance
- ‚úÖ Manual claim review process
- ‚úÖ Evidence-based dispute resolution

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Reputation Metrics
- **Total Rentals**: Number of completed rentals
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful rentals
- **Violations**: Number of reported violations
- **Early Revokes**: Number of early revokes
- **Blacklist Status**: Current blacklist status

### Economic Metrics
- **Insurance Pool**: Total insurance funds available
- **Total Payouts**: Total insurance payouts made
- **Penalty Revenue**: Total penalties collected
- **Dispute Resolution**: Success rate of dispute resolution
